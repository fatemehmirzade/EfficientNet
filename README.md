# EfficientNet
The presented code herein implements the algorithm outlined in the article titled "Automated Diagnosis of Pneumonia from Classification of Chest X-Ray Images using EfficientNet," with a specific focus on the following key aspects:

EfficientNet Architecture: EfficientNet is a family of CNNs designed to billions of FLOPS, attaining state-of-the-art performance. The architecture is grounded in a compound scaling methodology that involves the balanced and of dimensions of depth, width, and resolution with a set of predetermined scaling coefficients. Accordingly, EfficientNet can well balance network accuracy and computational efficiency, much better than many recently designed CNN models on most benchmarking scenarios.


The variant used in this research for EfficientNet, normally denoted from EfficientNet-B0 to EfficientNet-B7, provides a spectrum of sizes with increasing complexities. Every next iteration increases in size and improves according to accuracy, so EfficientNet-B0 is the smallest and most resource-efficient variant. For choosing the right variant for this study, dataset scale and available computational resources were taken into consideration.

Methodology:

Data Ingestion and Preprocessing: The dataset consists of chest X-ray images from multiple clinical and experimental sources; hence variability in image qualities and characteristics is added. Initial steps on the preprocessing front were: EDAâ€”Exploratory Data Analysis: this was where in-depth analysis had been done to understand the basic attributes of the dataset and distribution patterns. Data Cleaning: This was done to remove noise and extraneous data, which help to enhance the training model's effectiveness. Class Imbalance Mitigation: These are techniques that should ensure class balance, such as oversampling the minority classes or undersampling the majority. Data Augmentation: A subset of methods in which a dataset is synthetically augmented by creating image variations through different operations, such as rotation, flipping, and scaling. Transfer Learning and Fine-tuning: The process of transfer learning involves the use of a model pre-trained on a large dataset and fine-tuning it on a target task, in this case, detecting pneumonia. This process entails: Model Selection: Opting for EfficientNet due to its established performance and computational efficiency. Initial Training: Utilizing the EfficientNet model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset as the initial starting point. Fine-Tuning: Making necessary adjustments to the pre-trained model to align it with the chest X-ray dataset. This entails freezing the initial layers of the network to preserve learned features while training the latter layers on the new dataset to adapt to pneumonia-specific features. Model Evaluation: The performance of the EfficientNet model underwent comprehensive evaluation utilizing various metrics, including: Accuracy: Reflecting the proportion of correctly identified pneumonia cases relative to the total cases. Area Under the Curve (AUC): Quantifying the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative cases. Precision, Recall, and F1 Score: Offering nuanced insights into the model's precision, recall, and overall balance between the two through the harmonic mean of precision and recall (F1 score).
The ensuing results are delineated as follows:
